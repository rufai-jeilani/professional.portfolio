Welcome to my professional portfolio! I'm a senior at South Western Career Academy, where I'm pursuing my passion for cyber security. Currently, I'm gaining valuable experience as an Information Technology Intern at Root Insurance.

## About Me

My journey into tech wasn't traditional. After struggling in my freshman year, discovering PCs sparked my interest. Visiting South Western Career Academy and seeing the cyber security program, especially the "Pac-Man" file quarantine in Linux, immediately captivated me. Despite my initial lack of IT knowledge, I took a leap of faith and applied. This decision brought me immense joy as I finally found my calling. Since then, I've been determined to learn everything I can about networking and network security, always approaching my studies with enthusiasm. This dedication led to my successful application for a summer internship, which led to me working there over my senior year. Ultimately this all was a plan to shape my path in cyber security.
